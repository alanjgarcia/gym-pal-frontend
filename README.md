# GymPal

GymPal is an app designed to help people reach their personal fitness goals. Users can create specific workout routines using the exercises provided on the site. Each exercise has a diagram as well as a link to a video tutorial to perform each exercise safely and effectively. GymPal is an app with the goal of making fitness a social experience. Users will be able to share their routines with other users and schedule workouts together! 

GymPal was built using a Ruby on Rails backend and a JS.react frontend. 

## Installation



```bash

bundle install

rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
```
## Usage
```bash
rails server
```
You can test web requests as documented in the `requests.http` file.

## Roadmap
I plan on adding API's to allow users to share locations and find other users interested in working out and being a "gym pal". I would also like to add additional features such as a customizable calendar that allows for scheduling specific workout routines on specific days of the week.
